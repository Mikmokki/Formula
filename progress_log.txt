Progress check 1.

The main classes I have worked with are Formula and Track classes.
Move method is working correctly but the grid layout needs rounding of coordinates.
Track loads from the file but updating is not yet done.
GUI is showing tracks.txt file correctly

The biggest problem I am facing is noticing getting out of track as I have to now all
the grid blocks that are on the route between two blocks. I have made plan for it but
have not gotten it to work yet.

I have been doing work probably around 15 hours of work.

I think I am on the right pace with the project. I decided to do GUI first and skip the
text version as I thought the GUI would be the final user interface anyways.


Progress check 2.

All my work during these two weeks are been around GUI, formula and track classes.
I got the track saving method working so now all the fastest laps are saved and seen
while playing. I also have win condition and checkpoints so I think the game is now
playable. Also now I think I got the route working which was by far the hardest task
so far. Now it should not be possible to cut through a corner. I also added penalty
for getting out of track. I have done a lot of testing on all those methods.

There have been difficult bugs and problems but I have solved them quite well so far.

I have been doing work probably around 10-15 hours of work.

I think I have managed to do this project with pretty good pace. Now I think I have
intermediate level done after I make main menu with possibility to choose name for
formula. (If there are some obvious thing missing for that criterion,
 It would be nice to know :D ) So after that I will start thinking of possibilities to
 make the AI.

 Progress check 3.

After last progress check I have made an AI class that is able to finish the track multible
rounds without going out of track. I also did a lot of testing and got rid of some major
bugs. Also the formula's image is turning so it is easier for players to see where the
formula is going.

I have tested that the formula can't go over the grid at all even with different tracks.
Also now the bot is doing well. One annoying bug was that when the formula was rotating it would
go out of the grid spot from the corners and it left pieces of formula to the field. I decided
to crop the image to a circle shape so it would have the same size when turning and it worked.

I have been doing work probably around 15 hours of work.

I thing I am almost ready. Next I will start doing the main menu.
